## Source 
On the DIIA Open Data Portal, I downloaded balance sheet and income statement data provided by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine for 2023, 2022, and 2021. The data, in XML format, consisted of 82,912 files, raising my expectations for a big number of statements from various companies. However, I later discovered that the data covered only about 18,328 enterprises, with many having multiple versions of their statements.
